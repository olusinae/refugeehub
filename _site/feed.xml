&lt;p&gt;Most of this was about the portfolio for the projects that has been carried out all through the semester. She also emphasised on the need
to focus on having a final deliverable ready for submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sought for her help with the portfolio, after spending the previous night on getting my online portfolio jekyll site to function properly
without any success.
All attempts to get the site hosted and github pages with a custom theme was to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several trials of suggestions from Elise, it appeared that the problem came from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.
In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; variable was set to null, which means that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/asset/main.css&lt;/code&gt; file had no location to point to on the site build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, realising that, I changed the values of the baseurl to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baseurl: &quot;/refugeehub&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;refugeehub&lt;/code&gt; is the repo name for the portfolio on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing this, my portfolio was live and presented properly!…(Thanks to Elise!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the site has the default theme - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Minima&lt;/code&gt; rather than a customised, I was still satisfied. 
This is because more time and effort would be needed to override the default theme, which neither do I have before the semester ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I planned on researching on how to go about that over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Olufemi Ezekiel Olusina</name></author><summary type="html">In class today, Elise gave a brief presentation (a recap) on tasks that are required to be done, both as a group and individual.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Short Scrum</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/refugeehub/2017/10/31/short-scrum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Short Scrum" /><published>2017-10-31T00:00:00+13:00</published><updated>2017-10-31T00:00:00+13:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/refugeehub/2017/10/31/short-scrum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/refugeehub/2017/10/31/short-scrum.html">&lt;p&gt;We had a wee scrum led by me.

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I had a challenge with immplementing a design feature for the link tiles. I intended 
on making the text on the divs flow to the top of the div, with a transparent background on hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was only able to get it to flow from top to bottom. This was still not near what I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I asked for Adon’s help, with which I got a solution to my problem. Adon suggested some ideas which were really
effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, he explained to me what the css tags and values he suggested does. These include; absolute &amp;amp; relative, top, right,
bottom, left and how I could use html divs to control features on the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Olufemi Ezekiel Olusina</name></author><summary type="html">I was able to finish setting up the link tiles for the Refugee Information Page.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Addition of links to Refugee Information Page</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/refugeehub/2017/10/25/addition-of-links-to-refugee-information-page.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Addition of links to Refugee Information Page" /><published>2017-10-25T00:00:00+13:00</published><updated>2017-10-25T00:00:00+13:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/refugeehub/2017/10/25/addition-of-links-to-refugee-information-page</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/refugeehub/2017/10/25/addition-of-links-to-refugee-information-page.html">&lt;p&gt;I added divs with images that would be linking to contents in the page.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Testing:	
  Adon informed us about our project that would be tested by the Software Testing course students. I was appointed as the contact for my group. 
  This means that after deciding on a suitable time for both parties, we would have a selected Software Tesing student to test our project and give a feedback on the outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliberation and Decision on layout formats:
  To help with improvement on our project, I suggested that we all decide on a specific layout for the webpages, which we can all 	build on and maintain consistency. &lt;hyperlink&gt;This&lt;/hyperlink&gt; is the rough sketch/wireframe of the sellected layout is.&lt;/li&gt;
