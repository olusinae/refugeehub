&lt;p&gt;Initially, I had a challenge with immplementing a design feature for the link tiles. I intended 
on making the text on the divs flow to the top of the div, with a transparent background on hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was only able to get it to flow from top to bottom. This was still not near what I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I asked for Adon’s help, with which I got a solution to my problem. Adon suggested some ideas which were really
effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, he explained to me what the css tags and values he suggested does. These include; absolute &amp;amp; relative, top, right,
bottom, left and how I could use html divs to control features on the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was able to finish setting up the link tiles for the Refugee Information Page.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Addition of links to Refugee Information Page</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/10/25/addition-of-links-to-refugee-information-page.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Addition of links to Refugee Information Page" /><published>2017-10-25T00:00:00+13:00</published><updated>2017-10-25T00:00:00+13:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/10/25/addition-of-links-to-refugee-information-page</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/10/25/addition-of-links-to-refugee-information-page.html">&lt;p&gt;I added divs with images that would be linking to contents in the page. By default, the page should wrap and the links at the top of the
page would enable users to navigate the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while in the process of implementing the new feature, the header broke. The header contents floats to the left,
which was not as it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be looking into this tommorrow and fixing the anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I added divs with images that would be linking to contents in the page.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Brief catchup on progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing:	
  Adon informed us about our project that would be tested by the Software Testing course students. I was appointed as the contact for my group. 
  This means that after deciding on a suitable time for both parties, we would have a selected Software Tesing student to test our project and give a feedback on the outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliberation and Decision on layout formats:
  To help with improvement on our project, I suggested that we all decide on a specific layout for the webpages, which we can all 	build on and maintain consistency. &lt;hyperlink&gt;This&lt;/hyperlink&gt; is the rough sketch/wireframe of the sellected layout is.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,Aaron and I used that moment to encourage everyone to consider putting more effort into the project, especially 
those who have inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it was decided that the holidays should be spent focusing on individuals’ portfolio, and to put meetings on hold until resumption.

&lt;p&gt;The database set up was started by Nick and I joined him in making a few changes needed.
Also, I started preparing the files containing the php, html and css code needed for the login feature to Ninh so he could
make changes to fit in with the website layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unable to push the files on git for Ninh due to inappropriate saving, leading to the loss of the files. So this
would be done by Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">While still carrying out the research, some features were added.
