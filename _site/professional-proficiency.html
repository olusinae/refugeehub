    <h4 id="how-often-do-you-attend-scheduled-group-meetingsscrums">How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h4>

<h1 id="----">★ ★ ★ ★ ★</h1>

<p>My team has scheduled meetings every Monday outside of usual class times on Tuesday and Thursday, and I am always in attendance. 
This is with the exception of days that I am sick, for which I take permission to be excused.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/absence-excuse.png" alt="Excusing myself from meeting" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>The only reason that I might not have made it to the group meeting during usual class times, would be if  I have to 
attend the class for my actual Linux stream for test or SBA.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of notes that I took from one of our group meetings:</p>

<h4 id="how-well-did-you-communicate-with-others-in-your-group-or-subgroup">How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</h4>

<h1 id="---">★ ★ ★ ★</h1>

<p>I think that my commuinication is good, as I always try to keep everyone in the loop. I do respond promptly either in the
group chat or direct messages on Slack or Facebook messenger.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of my communication with my team members:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/communication.png" alt="Chat on Slack" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/communication2.png" alt="Chat on Slack" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h4 id="how-well-did-you-document-your-work-throughout-the-project">How well did you document your work throughout the project?</h4>

<h1 id="-----1">★ ★ ★ ★ ★</h1>

<p>Very well I think. I do keep records of activities during meetings (both visual and audio). And as well as ideas that are being shared.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of my documentation during a meeting:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/wireframe1.jpg" alt="Wireframe" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/wireframe2.jpg" alt="Wireframe" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Also, I do take notes at the meetings (most of the time or as required). Either in writing or audio recording.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of notes taken during a meeting:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/week 2-plan.jpg" alt="Meeting note" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>And here are some of the recorded audio at a meeting:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/audio/Meeting-with-client.mp3" alt="Meeting-with-client" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/audio/RefHub-Client-Briefing.mp3" alt="RefHub-Client-Briefing" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h4 id="how-well-did-you-respond-to-problems-or-changing-requirements">How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?</h4>

<h1 id="----1">★ ★ ★ ★</h1>

<p>I have been able to respond to changing requirements fairly well.</p>

<p>For instance, when it was decided that
we would be having PHP include files rather than HTML, I wasn’t quiet okay with it initially. This happened without kicking
up a fuss!</p>

<p>However, I reasoned with the idea and realised it was not so bad after all.</p>
