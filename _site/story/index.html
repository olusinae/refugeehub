  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In Software Engineering, I was put in a group of five persons to develop a tool to assist refugees with their settlement in Dunedin.</p>

<p>This started out a bit scary, considering that it would be my first time working in a group (that is as large as that) to author a tool. 
The platform to be used and methodology (such as Agile) to implement was totally left for us to decide upon.</p>

<h2 id="team-storming-and-norming">Team storming and norming</h2>
<p>This was a part that I dreaded a lot. Even though I expected that because everyone in the group were familiar with one another (to a certain extent I suppose), there would be less effort with the group norming.</p>

<p>However, this turned out to be one of the most challenging part at the initial stage.  It was always impossible to have all the team members at once in a meeting. 
Our client – Elise,had to post a message regarding this on slack. 
<img src="/assets/img/Elise-team-storming-and-norming.png" alt="Elise's post" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>This affected our progress with the project as it was hard making plans without the consent of the other group members.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to ensure progress, I suggested that the three out of five of us who were present at meetings should put some general ideas regarding the project together. These ideas would then be pitched to the other members (whenever they are around) to know what they think.</p>

<p>Also, I suggested that we set up accounts on communication means such as Slack and Trello and group project code versioning tool – GitLab. Despite all these, communication was still very minimal.</p>

<p>Many a times, I would have to tag the username of group members for them to realise that their contribution is needed.</p>

<p>However, there were some noticeable changes over time. Most individuals started showing up to class and Monday meetings. This was a day set apart outside of usual class times to review the project’s progress.
The Monday meetings outside of class seemed to help a lot.</p>

<p>Everyone showed up to the meetings most of the time and we would have a scrum, even though the duty of getting feedbacks, relaying ideas and leading scrums was totally on Aaron and myself (As no one else would opt to do so, if we don’t).</p>

<h2 id="team-work">Team-WORK</h2>
<p>This was another great challenge for me. Of course, I would have preferred to develop the tool on my own, but I suppose there would be no lesson to learn in being able to work in group.</p>

<p>Most of the group members have a good deal of knowledge with the platforms (HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP) we planned on using, however it was three of us who did most of the work.</p>

<p>Initially, we met to decide on the platform to use (either WordPress or Bootstrap) for building the project. This didn’t quiet go well as a team member suggested using WordPress, while everyone else (who are savvy in web development, as a team member has very little knowledge) said they were more familiar with Bootstrap. This ended up with that team member being having very little involvement at the initial stage.</p>

<p>We all agreed for everyone to carry out some research regarding a suitable template to implement, over the weekend of the first week. The outcomes were to be uploaded on the project’s <strong><a href="https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/MAHAA4/RefugeeHub/tree/master">Git Repo</a></strong> . 
It turned out that it was only Aaron, Ninh and I that did some research. I came up with <strong><a href="https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/MAHAA4/RefugeeHub/tree/master/SelectedRefugeeHubMock/web">this</a></strong> template.</p>

<p>We selected a template suggested by Aaron to build on. The only problem with <strong><a href="https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/MAHAA4/RefugeeHub/blob/master/template.html">this template</a></strong>  is that, it is a single file containing all the codes for structure, styling and functionality.</p>

<p>So, with the consent of other team members, I went ahead and tidied the file up. I put the CSS styling and JavaScript codes into separate files and linked them to the HTML file. 
Then I created a <strong><a href="https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/MAHAA4/RefugeeHub/tree/webpage-development/RefugeeHubFiles">folder</a></strong> on Git for the files. These files are then used as default files that everyone else build upon.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Aaron modified the files, changing the HTML files to PHP for everyone to use instead. This initially troubled me as I never saw the need for that. However, he gave reasonable reason for doing so, which was for security and more functionalities.</p>

<p>Getting through with merging of codes and being flexible with these changes has really improved my understanding, and ability to work and deal with such a large group.</p>

<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>This was a role I naturally found myself in, alongside Aaron. As there was no one who would offer or make the move to organise and lead scrums, I always have the impulse to lead and get team members to “talk”.</p>

<p>During meetings and on chat media, I always have to ask the <code class="highlighter-rouge">“What do you think?”</code> question in order for certain members to get involved in the discussion.
It was somehow tedious initially, being in this position. This is because while trying to be encouraging to everyone in the team, you always have to watch how you go about doing so in order not to seem “bossy” or “overzealous”.</p>

<p>As part of managing the team, rather than having Aaron or myself do some communication with the team, I asked Ninh to post a meeting’s feedback on Slack for the team.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/management.png" alt="Ninh's post" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Despite the challenges, I was able to find a balance between managing the team effectively and without aggravating anyone.</p>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>I am confident and proud of my communication with the team, throughout the whole process of developing the web app. To keep myself posted and as well as the team, I always ensure that I relay messages on the different chat media that we use.</p>

<p>Even if it’s about being excused from a meeting for being sick, I feel it’s imperative to inform everyone rather than not showing up. This I believe, does not show integrity.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/absence-excuse.png" alt="Excusing myself from meeting" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>In addition, after Nick and myself met with Rob – the department’s technician, regarding setting up a Database account on Kate (department’s server) for our group project, I posted the conversation on Slack for the team to see.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Rob.png" alt="Chat with Rob" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Rob2.png" alt="Feedback from Rob" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The development of this application has been an interesting process. From working with predefined CSS libraries to JavaScript and PHP for functionalities, every part of the process has proved to be useful even in other courses.</p>

<p>Through helping Cade with embedding google maps on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Refugee Hub Information Page</code> and adding markers on them, I was able to learn a lot. I now understand better how to add google maps and translate to website and style the <code class="highlighter-rouge">frame</code> to fit into context on one’s website.</p>

<p>Also, I never hesitated to ask Adon for help with certain styling problems when I was designing the <strong><a href="http://kate.ict.op.ac.nz/~se17group3/Olufemi/Refugee.php#">Refugee Hub Information Page</a></strong>. His suggestions were always super helpful and great!</p>

<p>Furthermore, I was able to pick up some coding styles from Aaron, which may come in handy on later projects. Aaron created <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> files for each section - <code class="highlighter-rouge">header</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">content</code> &amp; <code class="highlighter-rouge">footer</code> of the page.</p>

<p>At first, I never saw any use and relevance in that. However, it occurred to me that, such technique helps with code modularity.
To create a header for multiple pages and maintain consistency, all you have to do is include the header file!</p>

<p>I believe the efficient development of this tool has been hampered by the indifference of half of the team at the early stage.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Testing was a part I looked forward to, as this is one of the core parts of software development. 
I was selected by the Software Testing course as the main contact from my group.</p>

<p>The process was to involve having an individual from the Software Testing course, to carry out certain procedures on our website and give us feedback on the experience.</p>

<p>I believe this not been done well as; Firstly, our project does not seem stable enough to be tested. Secondly, Aaron offered to do the testing (because he is taking the Software Testing course) which I do not think was actualised.</p>

<p>Considering these, it appears that we have failed to accomplish that task effectively.</p>

<h2 id="version-control-git">Version Control: Git</h2>
<p>In every software development environment, one would expected (in this era at least), that the most important tool would be a version control system. This, I wish was true for my team.</p>

<p>Everyone in the team is familiar with GitLab, as this is widely used in most (if not all) the courses in the department. In spite of this, it was only three of us who made use of it the most.</p>

<p>Although each person has a folder on the group’s Kate server account, I think using Git for file management and control is more recommendable. This is because if Kate server goes offline, that means there is a high probability of file loss.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
<p>I always ensure that I document activities for each day I do some work on the project in a <strong><a href="index.md">timeline</a></strong>.</p>

<p>It was recommended to use an online portfolio, to present individual reports at the end of the project. 
In hindsight, I envisaged this scenario. So, I got a copy of the template I used to create an online portfolio based on Bootstrap framework for my <strong><a href="https://olusinae.github.io/spinner/index.html">Spinner project</a></strong> (initial project at the beginning of course).</p>

<p>However, Adon and Elise suggested (and encouraged) learning frameworks such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code> for online portfolios.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a static site generator that uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">markdown</code>(content) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">liquid</code>(styling) to generate a website. A very good advantage of this is that, having a blog-like post just got easier!</p>

<p>This means that, making a timeline of progress or project activities would be without stress.
In addition to this, it is possible to host the generated site on Github pages!</p>

<p>Although, this seemed like a great tool, it comes with certain costs. Setting up and learning to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code> was a tedious part.</p>

<h2 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h2>
<p>I did not have any idea or understanding of what Jekyll was, how it could be used and what it is used for. I only knew that it can be used to create static sites from text documents as input.</p>

<p>I tried learning about it from the <strong><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows">Jekyll documentation</a></strong> website on how to install Jekyll on Windows 10. This tutorial, however, didn’t provide me with much information that I felt I needed.</p>

<p>Although, the <strong><a href="https://github.com/KeJunMao/fastjekyll#autoinstall-jekyll-for-windows">auto install for Windows</a></strong> link was provided on the tutorial page, I was more interested in learning how to set Jekyll up from scratch.</p>

<p>Luckily, I found this <strong><a href="https://labs.sverrirs.com/jekyll/1-ruby-and-devkit.html">tutorial</a></strong> on the Jekyll installation guide page.</p>

<p>That helped a little bit, but not very much. This was due to variations in the version of Jekyll used in the tutorial and the version that I installed.</p>

<p>The Challenges I had were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time.</li>
  <li>Implementing bash on windows.</li>
  <li>Serving and Hosting.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I took these steps which was effective eventually;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dedicated at least 30 minutes every day to studying how to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code>.</li>
  <li>Watched instructional videos and read the Microsoft’s <strong><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about">documentation</a></strong> on using bash on windows.</li>
  <li>Sought after Adon’s help. Adon showed me how to go about writing posts and gave some recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project has provided me with a great experience and knowledge. Despite the problems with group norming at the initial stage, I believe that to some extent we have been able to achieve so much.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I think that the skills, such as being flexible in different situations and managing a team, that I have accumulated would be useful to other aspects of my career and in the future.</p>

<p>Overall throughout this project, I believe that we would have achieved more and perfected the tool, if everyone put in their best inputs.</p>
