#### How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?

# ★ ★ ★ ★ ★

My team has scheduled meetings every Monday outside of usual class times on Tuesday and Thursday, and I am always in attendance. 
This is with the exception of days that I am sick, for which I take permission to be excused.

The only reason that I might not have made it to the group meeting during usual class times, would be if  I have to 
attend the class for my actual Linux stream for test or SBA.

Here is a picture of notes that I took from one of our group meetings:

#### How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?

# ★ ★ ★ ★

I think that my commuinication is good, as I always try to keep everyone in the loop. I do respond promptly either in the
group chat or direct messages on Slack or Facebook messenger.


Here are some examples of my communication with my team members:

#### How well did you document your work throughout the project?

# ★ ★ ★ ★ ★

Very well I think. I do keep records of activities during meetings (both visual and audio). And as well as ideas that are being shared.

Here are some examples of my documentation during a meeting:

Also, I do take notes at the meetings (most of the time or as required). Either in writing or audio recording.

Here's an example of notes taken during a meeting:

And here are some of the recorded audio at a meeting:

#### How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?

# ★ ★ ★ ★


I have been able to respond to changing requirements fairly well. 

For instance, when it was decided that
we would be having PHP include files rather than HTML, I wasn't quiet okay with it initially. This happened without kicking
up a fuss!

However, I reasoned with the idea and realised it was not so bad after all.
