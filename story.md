## Introduction
In Software Engineering, I was put in a group of five persons to develop a tool to assist refugees with their settlement in Dunedin.
This started out a bit scary, considering that it would be my first time working in a group (that is as large as that) to author a tool. The platform to be used and methodology (such as Agile) to implement was totally left for us to decide upon.

## Team storming and norming
This was a part that I dreaded a lot. Even though I expected that because everyone in the group were familiar with one another (to a certain extent I suppose), there would be less effort with the group norming.
However, this turned out to be one of the most challenging part at the initial stage.  It was always impossible to have all the team members at once in a meeting. Our client – Elise, had to post a message regarding this on slack.

This affected our progress with the project as it was hard making plans without the consent of the other group members.

Meanwhile, to ensure progress, I suggested that the three out of five of us who were present at meetings should put some general ideas regarding the project together. These ideas would then be pitched to the other members (whenever they are around) to know what they think.

Also, I suggested that we set up accounts on communication means such as Slack and Trello and group project code versioning tool – Gitlab. Despite all these, communication was still very minimal. Many a times, I would have to tag the username of group members for them to realise that their contribution is needed.
However, there were some noticeable changes over time. Most individuals started showing up to class and Monday meetings. This was a day set apart outside of usual class times to review the project’s progress.

## Team-WORK
This was another great challenge for me. Of course, I would have preferred to develop the tool on my own, but I suppose there would be no lesson to learn in being able to work in group.
Most of the group members have a good deal of knowledge with the platforms (HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP) we planned to use, however it was three of us who did most of the work.

Initially, we met to decide on the platform to use (either WordPress or Bootstrap) for building the project. This didn’t quiet go well as a team member suggested using WordPress, while everyone else (who are savvy in web development, as a team member has very little knowledge) said they were more familiar with Bootstrap. This ended up with that team member being having very little involvement at the initial stage.

We all agreed for everyone to carry out some research regarding a suitable template to implement, over the weekend of the first week. The outcomes were to be uploaded on the project’s  [Git Repo]( https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/MAHAA4/RefugeeHub/tree/master) . 
It turned out that it was only Aaron, Ninh and I that did some research. I came up with [this]( https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/MAHAA4/RefugeeHub/tree/master/SelectedRefugeeHubMock/web) template.
We selected a template suggested by Aaron to build on. The only problem with [this template]( https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/MAHAA4/RefugeeHub/blob/master/template.html)  is that, it is a single file containing all the codes for structure, styling and functionality. So, with the consent of other team members, I went ahead and tidied the file up. I put the CSS styling and Javascript codes into separate files and linked them to the HTML file.

## Management

## Communication
During meetings and on chat media, I always have to ask the “What do you think?” question in order for certain members to get involved in the discussion.

## Development

## Testing


## SVN


## Conclusion
Overall throughout this project, I believe that if everyone would put in their best inputs, we would have had a better success.
