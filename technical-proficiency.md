#### What is the overall quality of your code like?

# ★ ★ ★

I think that my coding is improving. After selecting a template, I felt it would be nice to restructure
the template to have separate files, instead of one.

The initial template had HTML, CSS and Javascript codes all in one file!. 

So, basically, I cleaned the whole file up, which I think is a good coding style.

#### How well did you follow best practices in development?

# ★ ★ ★ ★

An example of this is found in the **[timeline](http://localhost:4000/refugeehub/2017/09/19/meeting-with-client.html)** of this portfolio.

As part of Agile process, after reaching a certain stage in the development we met with our client, for a feedback on the project.

So, I feel I have been able to follow best practices in development.

#### How well did you use appropriate version control?

# ★ ★ ★ ★ ★

I have made sure that this was paramount after making any changes to the source code files.

To avoid any loss of files and documents, other than saving the files securely locally, I always
push to Git. 

It also helps to be able to work easily from wherever I have access to the internet, as I will only need to `clone`
to a new local machine and `pull` to an existing one.

Here is snapshot of my commits on Git;

#### To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?

# ★ ★ ★ ★

I believe I have contributed a good deal to the project. I ensure that I am on task, do some extra work outside of class
and attend meetings.

In addition, at meetings, I have been able to lead scrums and manage the team.
