title: Addition of markers to map

Aaron added some markers to the map in Refugee information and the Organisational pages.

These markers would have the icon help centres and would mark the locations of the help centres.

Here's a screenshot of the Organisational page with the markers:

This has been done using [Google Map APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to integrate the map and marker functionality with the website.
