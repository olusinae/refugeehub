We all were unable to meet at once today due to a test for another course that we had to take. Ninh and I were only able to attend the 3pm class while Aaron, Cade and Nick were able to meet at 1pm.

However, it was a successfull day as we were able to get everyone around (even though it was at different times) and got something tangible done. 

The Homepage layout was modified and several other features were implemented. This made it possible to move some tasks from "doing" and "to do" to "done".

Personally, I wasnt able to do much, but i assisted with modifying the website layout.

Our next meeting was scheduled for Monday 11th of September.
