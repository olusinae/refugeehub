title: Meeting with Client
---
We had a brief discussion with our client, Elise and gave her updates on
the project.
Based on our previous meeting, it was decided that we carry out a research on the
information we planned on putting on the website. It appears that due to lack of sufficient data,
there is less progress made on the website.
Elise was quite satisfied with this.

Also, we had a database account set up for us on mariaDB for the forum feature.
