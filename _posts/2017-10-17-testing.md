- Brief catchup on progress.
- Testing:	
	Adon informed us about our project that would be tested by the Software Testing course students. I was appointed as the contact for my group. 
	This means that after deciding on a suitable time for both parties, we would have a selected Software Tesing student to test our project and give a feedback on the outcomes.
- Deliberation and Decision on layout formats:
	To help with improvement on our project, I suggested that we all decide on a specific layout for the webpages, which we can all 	build on and maintain consistency. <hyperlink>This</hyperlink> is the rough sketch/wireframe of the sellected layout is.
