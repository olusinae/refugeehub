#### Brief catchup on progress.

#### Testing

Adon informed us about our project that would be tested by the Software Testing course students. I was appointed as the contact for my group. This means that after deciding on a suitable time for both parties, we would have a selected Software Tesing student to test our project and give a feedback on the outcomes.

#### Deliberation and Decision on layout formats:

To help with improvement on our project, I suggested that we all decide on a specific layout for the webpages, which we can all build on and maintain consistency.

Here are the rough sketch/wireframe of the sellected layout is:
