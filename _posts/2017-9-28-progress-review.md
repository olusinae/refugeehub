title: Progress Review
---
We had a brief meeting to review our progress so far. It appears that we still have a very long way to go.
There should have been a much more improvment if there was an active support from every member.

Hence,Aaron and I used that moment to encourage everyone to consider putting more effort into the project, especially 
those who have inputs.

Also, it was decided that the holidays should be spent focusing on individuals' portfolio, and to put meetings on hold until resumption.
I have not been able to finish preparing the log in files for Ninh, but I hope to on resumption.
