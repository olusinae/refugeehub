title: Refugee Information Page Update
---

I was able to finish setting up the link tiles for the Refugee Information Page.

Initially, I had a challenge with immplementing a design feature for the link tiles. I intended on making the text on the divs flow to the top of the div, with a transparent background on hover.

However, I was only able to get it to flow from top to bottom. This was still not near what I imagined.

So, I asked for Adon's help, with which I got a solution to my problem. Adon suggested some ideas which were really
effective.

In addition, he explained to me what the css tags and values he suggested does. These include; absolute & relative, top, right, bottom, left and how I could use html divs to control features on the webpage.
