title: Presentation of project
---
We had our project presentation yesterday to the whole class and our clients. The presentation went succesfully and I think that our client was quite pleased with our progress.

We presented the current [stable version](http://kate.ict.op.ac.nz/~se17group3/RefHubFinal/Home.php) of the Web App which, to some extent was
in a presentable state.

I really acknowledge Aaron's effort in organising everyone and working on merging the files together to a final presentable product. Also, I had to fix some issues with the Refugee Information page and added some images to the links.

Here is an snapshot of the final version of Refugee Information Page after fixing:

Nick did a really good job with implementing the live chat and forum feature on the website. It was thought by everyone initially, that it
might not be possible eventually.
However, we were able to present the feature to the class "proudly". This gave everyone such a great rewarding feeling!.

Here's a screenshot of the chat forum page:

Although, we are still yet to finish the project, I think its been such a great experience and I hope that we would be able to have it fully done by Friday.
