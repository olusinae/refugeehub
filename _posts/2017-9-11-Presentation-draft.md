title: Presentation Draft Prep
---
I was quite unwell and was unable to attend the scheduled meeting.
	However, based on the reports and feedback from the meeting, a draft for presentation for the next class was made.
	The draft has milestones that has been achieved and the ones that needs to be reached.
