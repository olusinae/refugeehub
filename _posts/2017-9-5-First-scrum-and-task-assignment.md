title: First Scrum and Task Assignment
---

We had a scrum during class time led by me. The purpose of the scrum was to review what we have achieved so far and what we still have ahead.

It was also a moment to charge group members who have not been contributing much to the project.

After much discussion, it was clear to everyone what tasks we have at hand and how to go about achieving them. 
We realised that there is need for us to make use of kanban for tracking activites/tasks on trello to ensure efficiency.

Hence, after the scrum, we all logged on to trello and made cards of tasks we have completed, tasks we are working on and the ones we need to embark on later.

Each member was also assigned to at least a task to ensure that we are able to check on each other, whenever someone is lagging behind. I assigned myself to finishing the `Refugee Information Page`

Notifications of this was put on slack by Aaron for everyone to see, most especially Cade, who was absent.
