title: Database setup and Login feature
---
While still carrying out the research, some features were added. The user registration feature was added.

The database set up was started by Nick and I joined him in making a few changes needed.
Also, I started preparing the files containing the php, html and css code needed for the login feature to Ninh so he could
make changes to fit in with the website layout.

I was unable to push the files on git for Ninh due to inappropriate saving, leading to the loss of the files. So this
would be done by Thursday.
