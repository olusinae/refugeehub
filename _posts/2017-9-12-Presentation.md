We had our presentation in class today. The presentation was aimed at us gving a report and overview of what we are doing, what we have achieved and what we are aiming to achieve. Nick was absent, which left Cade, Aaron, Ninh and I to present to our client and other colleagues.
After the presentation, we worked on the web app and made some modifications to it. 
A few  of the things I changed include;

<ul>
<li>Navs copied into respective pages from navheader.php.</li>

<li>Hiding the google translate banner(in refugeehub.css)</li>

<li>Making the navs hover background color(In refugeehub.css).</li>

<li>Making the selected page have a background color to show active page(In refugeehub.css and navs inside form).</li>

<li>Resizing the nav bar height at the top of the pages in refugeehub.css.</li>

<li>Changing the format of nav links in their forms(i.e putting the "a href" outside of the "li").</li>

<li>Removing text decoration&list-style-type from navs in refugeehub.css</li>
</ul>
