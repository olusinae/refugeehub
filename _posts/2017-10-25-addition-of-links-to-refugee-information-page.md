title: Addition of links to Refugee Information Page
---
I added divs with images that would be linking to contents in the page. By default, the page should wrap and the links at the top of the
page would enable users to navigate the page.

However, while in the process of implementing the new feature, the header broke. The header contents floats to the left,
which was not as it was. 

I would be looking into this tommorrow and fixing the anomaly.
